# IMAREV - imagery reversal
Neural dynamics of perceptual inference and its reversal during imagery

Code is executed in the correct order from the master script 'MasterWrapper.m'. 
The pipeline requires Fieldtrip to be installed (http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/download/)

To run the simulations ('/Simulations'), the example data from which the pink noise is sampled can be 
downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qXaIFYu4IxqytHlClIO5Xe3jYcBfA1XY?usp=sharing
